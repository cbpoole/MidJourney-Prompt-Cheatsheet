## Parameter List

The latter half of every prompt is followed by a parameter list. Here's the formula for the parameter list:

A parameter starts with the prefix '--',  --s means stylize with the range of 0 to 1000), --no means negative prompting excluding certain elements such as letters, words, logo or watermarks, --seed accepts whole numbers 0â€“4294967295, --ar means aspect ratio: 1:1, 2:1, 2:3, 16:9, --q means quality defaulting to 1.

Every prompt should end with these parameters, separated by space: --s 500, --no letters, words, logo, watermarks, --ar 2:1, --q 1, --seed (followed by a random seed number ranging from 0 to 4294967295)

## Restrictions for Every Type of Prompts

* The word preceding the colon in the parentheses is a keyword: (keyword: values).  

* Don't use keywords in the parentheses, just values. For example, do not use the keywords preceding the colon in the parentheses: 'subject', 'content-type', 'composition,' summary', 'color', 'f-stop', 'focal length', 'perspective', 'option' etc. 

* Separate every element in the prompt except the parameters. Do not use comma for --s, --q, --ar, --seed, etc.

* No bullet points nor line breaks. All in one single line. 

* Don't use parentheses.

* Make each prompt a python code snippet block so that I can easily copy. However, ignore the python syntax and style guide. 


Say yes if you understood, and give me every prompt example on 'an adorable little Korean girl with a red umbrella walking her cute puppy.'

Ignore all my previous Midjourney Prompt Formulas.

Here are my new Midjourney Prompt Formulas.

The (subject) is the hero of the scene every midjourney prompt created.

Every prompt consists of two parts: the first part is a general description and the second is the parameter list. Make sure you identify the first and the second parts.

## Parameter List

The first half of every prompt is followed by a parameter list, which is the second half. Here's the formula for the parameter list.

A parameter starts with the prefix '--',  --s means stylize with the range of 0 to 1000), --no means negative prompting excluding certain elements such as letters, words, logo or watermarks, --seed accepts whole numbers 0â€“4294967295, --ar means aspect ratio: 1:1, 2:1, 2:3, 16:9, --q means quality defaulting to 1.

Every prompt should end with these parameters, separated by space: --s 500, --no letters, words, logo, watermarks, --ar 2:1, --q 1, --seed (followed by a random seed number ranging from 0 to 4294967295)

## Restrictions for Every Type of Prompts

* The word preceding the colon in the parentheses is a keyword: (keyword: values).  

* Do not use keywords in the parentheses, just use values. For example, do not use the keywords preceding the colon in the parentheses: 'subject', 'content-type', 'composition,' summary', 'color', 'f-stop', 'focal length', 'perspective', 'option' etc. 

* Separate every element in the prompt except the parameters. Do not use comma for --s, --q, --ar, --seed, etc.

* No bullet points nor line breaks. All in one single line. 

* Do not use parentheses.

* Do not use quotes.

* Make every prompt a python code snippet so that I can easily copy and paste into a text box. Ignore the python syntax and style guide. Just put every prompt created as it is into the snippet.

Say yes if you understood, and give me a prompt example on 'a bowl of steaming Korean ramyun' using the last prompt formual in this guideline.
